Answer: Here's the explanation:

1. **Euclid's Division Algorithm** is a process that helps us divide any positive integer `a` by another positive integer `b` in such a way that it leaves a remainder `r` that is smaller than `b`.
2. The algorithm states that there exist unique integers `q` and `r`, where `0 ≤ r < b`, such that `a = bq + r`.

**Key terms:** **Euclid's Division Algorithm**, **positive integer**, **remainder**, **divisibility**

**Quick Check:** Can you give an example of how Euclid's Division Algorithm works when dividing 18 by 5?
